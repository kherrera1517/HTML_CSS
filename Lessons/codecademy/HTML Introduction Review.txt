INTRODUCTION TO HTML
Review
Congratulations on completing the first lesson of HTML & CSS! You are well on
 your way to becoming a skilled web developer.

Let's review what you've learned so far:

-HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create the structure
 and content of a webpage.
-Most HTML elements contain opening and closing tags with raw text or other HTML
 tags between them.
-Single-closing tags cannot enclose raw text or other elements.
-Comments are written in HTML using the following syntax: <!-- comment -->.
-HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. The enclosed element is the
 child of the enclosing parent element.
-Whitespace between HTML elements helps make code easier to read while not
 changing how elements appear in the browser.
-Indentation also helps make code easier to read. It makes parent-child
 relationships visible.
-The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration should always be the first line of code in your
 HTML files.
-The <html> element will contain all of your HTML code.
-Information about the web page, like the title, belongs within the <head> of
 the page.
-You can add a title to your web page by using the <title> element, inside of
 the head.
-A webpage's title appears in a browser's tab.
-Code for visible HTML content is placed inside of the <body> element.
What you learned in this lesson constitutes the required setup for all HTML
 files. The rest of the course will teach you more about how to add content
