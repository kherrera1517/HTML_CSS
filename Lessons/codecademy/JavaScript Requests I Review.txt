REQUESTS I
Review Requests I
-JavaScript is the language of the web because of its asynchronous capabilities.
 A set of tools that are used together to take advantage of JavaScript's
 asynchronous capabilities is called AJAX, which stands for Asynchronous
 JavaScript and XML.

-There are four HTTP request methods, two of which are GET and POST.

-GET requests only request information from other sources.

-POST methods can introduce new information to other sources in addition to
 requesting it.

-GET requests can be written using an XMLHttpRequest object and vanilla
 JavaScript.

-POST requests can also be written using an XMLHttpRequest object and vanilla
 JavaScript.

-Writing GET and POST requests with XHR objects and vanilla JavaScript requires
 constructing the XHR object using new, setting the responseType, creating a
 function that will handle the response object, and opening and sending the
 request.

-Much of the boilerplate used to write GET and POST requests with XHR and
 vanilla JavaScript can be reduced by using the $.ajax() method from the jQuery
 library.

-jQuery provides other helper methods that can further reduce boilerplate such
 as $.get(), $.post(), and $.getJSON().

-Determining how to correctly write the requests and how to properly implement
 them requires carefully reading the documentation of the API with which you're
 working.
