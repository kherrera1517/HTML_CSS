VARIABLES
Review Variables
Nice work! This lesson covered a lot of foundational skills that you will often
 use in your future programming endeavors.

Let's review what we learned:

-Variables hold reusable data in a program.
-JavaScript will throw an error if you try to reassign const variables.
-You can reassign variables that you create with the let keyword.
-Unset variables store the primitive data type undefined.
-Mathematical assignment operators make it easy to calculate a new value and
 assign it to the same variable.
-The + operator is used to interpolate (combine) multiple strings.
-In JavaScript ES6, backticks (`) and ${} are used to interpolate values into a
 string.
