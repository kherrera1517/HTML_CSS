HTML Tags
While some tags have a very specific purpose, such as image and video tags, most
 tags are used to describe the content that they surround, which helps us modify 
 and style our content later. There are seemingly infinite numbers of tags to 
 use (many more than we've taught). Knowing when to use each one is based on how
 you want to describe the content of your HTML. Descriptive, well-chosen tags 
 are one key to high-quality web development. A full list of available HTML tags 
 can be found here.

You now know all of the basic elements you need to structure an HTML page and 
 add different types of content. Very soon you’ll be creating beautiful 
 websites!

Let’s review what you’ve learned in this lesson:

-Headings and sub-headings, <h1> to <h6> tags, are used to enlarge text.
-<p>, <span> and <div> tags specify text or blocks.
-The <em> and <strong> tags are used to emphasize text.
-Line breaks are created with the <br> tag.
-Ordered lists (<ol>) are numbered and unordered lists (<ul>) are bulleted.
-Images (<img>) and videos (<video>) can be added by linking to an existing
 source.
-Anchor tags (<a>) are used to link to internal pages, external pages or content
 on the same page.
-You can create sections on a webpage and jump to them using <a> tags and 
 addings ids to the elements you wish to jump to.
-The nav element contains links to internal pages or content.
-Take some time to edit the workspace you created and observe how it changes!
